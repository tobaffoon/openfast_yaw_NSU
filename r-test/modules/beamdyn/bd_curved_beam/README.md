Test Name: bd_curved_beam
-------------------------

Curved-beam problem described in Bathe and Bolourchi (1979).

Beam lies in the x-z plane with a tip force of 600 lbs acting in the 
positive y direction.  Beam is curved on a radius of 100 inches in the positive 
x direction through a 45 degree arc.

Geometric properties

- Cross section: 1 in x 1 in

Material properties

- Elastic Modulus, E = 10**7 psi
- Poisson Ratio, nu = 0

Diagonal stiffness matrix entries

- kGA = 41.6667E+5
- kGA = 41.6667E+5
- EA = 100.E+5
- EI_1 = 8.333E+5
- EI_2 = 8.333E+5
- GJ = 8.333E+5
